# Mausum
A one stop weather application.
It is a collection of various tools to enhance usability, interactions and experience of a weather application.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every morning, before leaving for work, a person glances at their weather app. Why? To decide what to wear — do they need a jacket? Should they carry an umbrella? Or can they plan a sunbathing session by the river?

But how often do we really get answers to our actual curiosities about the weather? All we usually see is the same old temperature reading, a fancy "feels like" number, and a barebones hourly forecast.

In this era of convenience, is that really enough?

With all the advancements in user experience design and the modern functionality of various tools, how is it that weather apps remain universally archaic — barely evolving toward any meaningful innovation?

This proposal aims to solve the omnipresent, yet rarely identified, problem of “boomer weather applications.”

# What Mausum offers:
Show weather data (duh) — but in a way that actually gives meaningful insights.

Display forecast data (duh again) — but with suggestions for clothing, accessories, or activities based on your preferences and behavior learned over time.

Travel planner based on weather (the biggest duhhh):

How has this idea been “under the radar” (pun intended) for so long?

I want a way to figure out travel plans based on my budget, available time, preferred travel distance, mode of transportation, and desired weather conditions.
(Doesn’t that sound like a realistic and practical ask?)
